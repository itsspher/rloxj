This is a Rust implementation of "Lox", a language described in [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This project was made to compensate for a botched class in compilers that was given in my final semester in college.  
Since I learned nothing due to the professors never showing up, this project exists.
